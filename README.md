# Catalog of Books

1) For creating, receiving, modifying and deleting books must have API
2) The API must have swagger documentation which you can test methods.
3) When creating an API, you can use any framework (gin, fiber, bego, echo).
4) Books should be stored in postgresql.
5) There are must be at least two tables in database, for example (books, book_category) and they must be interconnected (reference).
6) Separate API methods from postgres methods to create a microservice and use grpc.
